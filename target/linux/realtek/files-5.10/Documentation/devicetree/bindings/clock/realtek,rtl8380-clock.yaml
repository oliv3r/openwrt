description: |
  The driver provides basic clock support for the central core clock unit (CCU)
  and its PLLs inside the RTL838X, RTL8389X and RTL930X SOC. All provided clocks
  are derived from an oscillator that runs at a fixed speed of 25 MHz. Currently
  switch, CPU, memory and LXB (Lexra Bus) clock information can be accessed. The
  clocks can be referenced by 'include/dt-bindings/clock/rtl83xx-clk.h'.

  If changing of clock speeds is required then SRAM must be defined via DT.
  The relevant code is copied to SRAM and run from there. To provide SRAM
  see http://devicetree.org/schemas/sram/sram.yaml#. E.g.

  sram0: sram@9f000000 {
      compatible = "mmio-sram";
      reg = <0x9f000000 0x18000>;
      #address-cells = <1>;
      #size-cells = <1>;
      ranges = <0 0x9f000000 0x18000>;
  };

  If SRAM is enabled and clock changing is allowed the driver can be directly
  used by the DT based cpufreq driver (enabled by CONFIG_CPUFREQ_DT). At least
  if CPU references the right clock and sane operating points (OPP) are
  provided. E.g.

  cpu@0 {
      compatible = "mips,mips4KEc";
      reg = <0>;
      clocks = <&ccu CLK_CPU>;
      operating-points-v2 = <&cpu_opp_table>;
  };

  cpu_opp_table: opp-table-0 {
      compatible = "operating-points-v2";
      opp-shared;
      opp00 {
          opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <425000000>;
      };
      ...
  }

  Changing of clocks is often realized by busy waiting. When using that feature
  the additional load should be considered.

properties:
  "#clock-cells":
    const: 1

  compatible:
    enum:
      - realtek,rtl8380-clock
      - realtek,rtl8390-clock
      - realtek,rtl9300-clock

required:
  - "#clock-cells"
  - compatible

    ccu: clock-controller {
        compatible = "realtek,rtl9300-clock";
        #clock-cells = <1>;
    };
